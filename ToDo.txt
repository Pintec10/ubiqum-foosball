 * Logout (add axios)

 * upload picture in CreateAccount

 * implement maxTeamNumber & picture in createTournament when backend ready

 * password breach on login??

 * implement Matches and Leaderboard buttons in TournamentTile

 * substitute encodeBody in login (and elsewhere?) if it works from outside

 * change join tournament/leave tournament depending on whether user is registered to it

 * createTeam -> Matches -> Leaderboard(tournament)

 * if team is to be created only with both members, add "required" to teammate field in CreateTeam

 * matches: be sure to have a message if there are no matches to view




 
per Lluis:

(more important)
--- get names of players (and scores) from id
--- where do I find the matches?
--- endpoint to create a team with 2 people AND register them to the tournament

(less important)
- add support to upload images for tournament, teams & players
- add a max allowed nr of teams when creating tournament (if we want that)
- close tournament endpoint
- logout endpoint


per Celina:
- start Tournament: need to place this function somewhere (will be admin-only)
- should we place Tournaments filters as a bottom bar?
- disabled button styling
- center the div with <Notification> in Tournaments
- add loader in Tournaments


more:
- We should agree on the dynamics of joining a tournament and creating a team
With current backend endpoints, it is a 4-steps process:
    1. user joins tournament
    2. user creates team in that tournament
    3. teammate joins tournament
    4. user adds teammate to team

With the current wireframes, it is seen as a 1-step process:
    1. user joins tournament by creating a team which already includes a team-mate
    This however does not support existence of teamless players.

    If we want to include teamless player support, we need to modify the wireframes:
        * have different buttons to join as solo player and to create a team (now we have only a "join" button)
        * include a new view to add a player to an existing team
        * perhaps add a view with a list of teamless players?
    If we decide to use the logic of joining tournament only with a full team, it would be best to modify the team creation back-end to:
        * add a teammate field 
        * perhaps register the team creator and teammate automatically to the tournament? 
        (or I could just make 4 axios calls...)
