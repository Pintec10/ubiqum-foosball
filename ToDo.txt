 * Logout (add axios)

 * upload picture in CreateAccount

 * implement maxTeamNumber & picture in createTournament when backend ready

 * password breach on login??

 * implement Matches and Leaderboard buttons in TournamentTile

 * substitute encodeBody in login (and elsewhere?) if it works from outside

 * change join tournament/leave tournament depending on whether user is registered to it

 * createTeam -> Matches -> Leaderboard(tournament)




 
per Lluis:
- get names of players (and scores) from id
- add images for tourn, teams & players
- add max allowed nr of teams to create tournament
- close tournament
- leave team
- create team with 2 people already?
- logout?


per Celina:
- start Tournament: need to place this function somewhere (will be admin-only)
- should we place Tournaments filters as a bottom bar?
- disabled button styling
- center the div with <Notification> in Tournaments
- add loader in Tournaments


more:
- joining a tournament: only by creating a team (right now it's like that)? 
    if not, where do we place teamless player info? 
    and where do we put the link to team creation?
    we might use two different buttons: "join as player" and "join as team"
    is it ok that only team admin can add mate?
